# ORB_SLAM-IOS
This is iOS port of [ORB-SLAM Monocular](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM) with modified dependency for iOS.

Thanks for [egoist-sx/ORB_SLAM_iOS](https://github.com/egoist-sx/ORB_SLAM_iOS) . 

I removed pod and metal view. Use opencv to capture the camera and draw the map points for show.

You need to download some dependency and opencv2.framework from
https://pan.baidu.com/s/1eS9ha74

Unzip orbslamios.zip and put the dependency folder and opencv2.framework in the orbslamios folder.

You can do some AR projects. There are more interesting AR videos on my YouTube.

If you are interested in SLAM-AR, you can see my another project [Stereo-SLAM-AR](https://github.com/ygx2011/Stereo_SLAM_AR).
